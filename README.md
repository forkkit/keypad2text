## About

This is a silly project that I made a while back. I am from an era where you had to text people using the [keypad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypad) of your cell phone. Want to send the letter 's'? You better press the 7 key 5 times.

## How to use

*Text to Keypad*
Enter text on the input field and click convert to generate keypad code.

*Keypad to Text*
Enter the keypad code on the input field and click convert to generate text.
